# Notify When Done

Notify When Done (NWD) is a utility for triggering alerts when a process finishes. Kicking off a long-running compile? NWD can post a popup notification when it's done. Starting a job on a remote server? NWD can send you an e-mail when it's done. Want to run a custom script once another finishes? NWD can facilitate that, too.

## Installation

```
pip3 install nwd
```

## Examples

Post a desktop notification (the default behavior) when the process with PID 1337 finishes:
```
$ nwd 1337
```

Send an e-mail when `cmake` finishes:
```
$ nwd --name cmake --mode email
```
You will be prompted to enter SMTP credentials as well as the recipient's e-mail address. This can optionally be stored in the system keychain, and can be set in advance by running `nwd --email-credentials`.

List all notifications, and cancel an existing notification:
```
$ nwd --list
PID  |Name     |Started                 |Ended                   |Status
-----+---------+------------------------+------------------------+----------

$ nwd --delete 34969
Deleted NWD daemon PID 34972 monitoring PID 34969
```

Run a command to monitor directly from NWD:
```
$ nwd --exec 'make -j4'
```

Execute a command when a process finishes:
```
$ nwd 1337 --run 'echo Process 1337 finished!'
```
